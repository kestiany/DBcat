# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for modernizing the DBCat application's user interface. The goal is to create a more streamlined, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface while maintaining all existing functionality. The improvements focus on removing redundant elements, adding theme customization options, and implementing a custom window frame for a more modern look.

### Requirement 4: Responsive Layout
